# SyscallHooks
Basic Syscall Hooks with Help Of Frida

Badly coded by Myself ( @ApkUnpacker )

Note : Not all syscall arguments are parsed yet. Happy to see PR Regarding That

Inspired From Interruptor and this is nothing compare to what interruptor can do.

So Recommended to use Interruptor which is much much powerful than this noobish script
